Questions on the logic of connectives 
-------------------------------------

1. **[1pt]** Give an example of your own (don't just rephrase or translate
   Kearns') on why truth-conditional connectives
   is not enough to capture natural language semantics.

    ```
    Answer:

    ```
1. **[1pt]** If you think of predicates as functions, what would be the type of their return
   values?

    ```
    Answer:

1. **[2pts]** You are given that Mary, a graduate student, is such that:

    1. If she studies, she  gets good grades.
    1. If she doesn't study, she enjoys life.
    1. If she doesn't get good grades, she doesn't enjoy life.

    Symbolize these statements in propositional logic and construct a truth-tree (or any other method of your choice) to
    answer the following questions. You do not need to include your tree (or table) in the solution:

    - Does she enjoy life?
    - Does she get good grades?

    ```
    Answer:

1. We have the following information:

    1. If samples are contaminated, then there is leakage in the reactor or there is non-consumed fuel.
    1. All the fuel is consumed.
    1. There is no leakage in the reactor or the detector is malfunctioning.
    1. The detector is functioning properly.

    Someone asserts that samples are contaminated. Do we need to believe? Motivate
    your answer by constructing a truth-tree (or table). You do not need to include your tree (or table) in the solution.

1. The examples of predicates in Kearns' Ch 2 all relate individuals (or
   sentences) to each other or attribute certain properties to them. Can you
   think of predicates that take other predicates as arguments?

    ```
    Answer:
